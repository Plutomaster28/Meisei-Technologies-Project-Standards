# Meisei Technologies Project Standards

---

### 1. **Purpose**

The Meisei Standard aims to establish a consistent framework for all projects within Meisei Technologies. Its primary objectives are to:
- **Improve Quality**: Ensure that all projects meet a high standard of performance, security, and maintainability.
- **Enhance Consistency**: Promote uniform practices across different teams and projects to streamline workflows and reduce redundancy.
- **Facilitate Collaboration**: Create a common understanding for contributors, enabling smoother collaboration within teams and with external partners.
  
Additionally, the Meisei Standard seeks to:
- **Encourage Innovation**: While maintaining structure, it fosters creativity by reducing ambiguity and allowing developers to focus on building innovative solutions.
- **Support Scalability**: Provide a foundation that can easily adapt and scale with project complexity, from small modules to large, enterprise-level systems.
- **Maintain Flexibility**: Allow for flexibility where needed, balancing between standardized practices and the need for project-specific adjustments.

---

### 2. **Scope**

The Meisei Standard applies primarily to the following areas:

- **Software Development**: Establishes guidelines for writing, structuring, and maintaining code across all projects. This includes coding conventions, version control practices, and deployment procedures.
  
- **Documentation**: Defines standards for creating and maintaining project documentation, ensuring clear communication of project details, usage instructions, and technical specifications.

While the standard focuses on software development and documentation, the testing process remains flexible. Testing is intended to be a dynamic, open-ended approach to identifying and resolving issues, allowing teams to adopt whichever methods work best for their specific project needs.

### 3. **Coding Conventions**

In general, code should be functional, legible, and well-organized. Specific guidelines include:

- **Code Readability**: Code should be structured in a clear and logical manner, making it easy for others to understand and contribute. This includes proper indentation, consistent naming conventions, and the use of whitespace to separate logical sections.
  
- **Naming Conventions**: Variable, function, and class names should be descriptive and relevant to their purpose. If the name or functionality is complex or ambiguous, additional documentation must be provided to clarify its use.

- **Documentation**: While code should be self-explanatory whenever possible, sufficient documentation must be added for any section that might be confusing or unclear. This includes:
  - Inline comments for complex logic or non-obvious code behavior.
  - External documentation for larger components, detailing how they work and how to use them.
  
- **Neatness**: Code should be neatly organized and free from unnecessary complexity. Strive for simplicity where possible, ensuring that the code is clean and easy to maintain.

The goal is to ensure that all code is easy to read, understand, and maintain, allowing for smooth handovers and collaboration between team members.

### 4. **Documentation Standards**

Effective documentation is essential for clear communication and project maintenance. The Meisei Standard outlines the following guidelines:

- **README Files**: Each project should include a README file that serves as an introduction. The file should provide:
  - Basic or **crucial information** about the project (e.g., purpose, installation instructions, dependencies).
  - A clear and concise explanation of the project's overall function, ensuring new users and contributors can quickly understand its purpose.

- **Inline Comments**: 
  - Inline comments should **explain what specific parts of the code do** and **indicate where functions lead** if not immediately obvious.
  - Comments should be used sparingly and meaningfully, avoiding unnecessary or redundant explanations while focusing on complex sections of the code.

- **API Documentation**: 
  - For projects that include APIs, detailed API documentation is required. This documentation should:
    - Describe the API's **purpose, functionality, and available methods**.
    - Provide comprehensive explanations of **each function** (e.g., parameters, return values, error handling).
    - Offer clear examples of usage to help developers integrate the API easily.

The level of complexity in the documentation should match the complexity of the codebase, ensuring that key details are not overlooked while keeping the content concise where possible.

### 5. **Version Control**

Proper version control ensures that all changes are tracked, organized, and easily managed across projects. The following guidelines apply to all projects:

- **Branching Strategies**:
  - While specific branching strategies may vary between projects, all changes should be organized into **separate branches** based on their nature:
    - **Bug Fixes**: Small changes that address specific bugs should have their own branch (e.g., `fix/issue-123`).
    - **Minor Changes**: Additions or deprecations of single functions, small features, or adjustments should have dedicated branches (e.g., `feature/add-new-function`).
    - **Major Changes**: Larger modifications, such as reworking entire files or refactoring major parts of the codebase, should be isolated in their own branches (e.g., `rework/header-file`).
    - **Updates**: General updates that include documentation improvements or maintenance tasks can also be organized into their own branch (e.g., `update/docs`).
  
  This separation ensures that each type of change is properly isolated and can be reviewed and merged independently.

- **Commit Messages**:
  - Commit messages should be clear and descriptive, summarizing the change made and referencing issue numbers when applicable (e.g., `Fixed memory leak in function X, resolves #123`).
  
- **Pull Requests**:
  - Each branch should be merged into the main branch through pull requests, with a clear description of the changes made, ensuring that all team members can review and discuss the update.

- **Recommended Platform**:
  - **GitHub** is the recommended platform for version control. Projects should be hosted on GitHub to enable collaborative development, version tracking, and code review.

### 6. **Testing Standards**

Testing within the Meisei Standard is flexible, focusing solely on identifying and resolving issues. The dynamic nature of testing allows for different strategies depending on the scope and type of change being tested. However, tests can generally be classified into the following categories:

- **Integration Testing**:
  - Ensures that new components or features integrate smoothly with existing systems. These tests focus on verifying that new additions do not disrupt overall functionality.

- **File Compatibility Testing**:
  - Verifies that individual files (e.g., new scripts or modules) are compatible with the current project structure. This testing checks for dependency conflicts, broken imports, or errors resulting from new files.

- **Chunk Compatibility Testing**:
  - Tests whether larger sections of the project (e.g., entire modules, systems, or reworks) are compatible with the existing codebase. This ensures that major updates or additions can be integrated without introducing critical errors.

These classifications are flexible, and testing methods should be adapted to the specific needs of each project. The primary goal of testing is to find and fix issues as early as possible, ensuring the stability and reliability of the software.

### 7. **Deployment Guidelines**

Deployments in the Meisei Standard aim to ensure smooth updates to the codebase and seamless rollbacks when necessary. The guidelines include:

- **Release Process**:
  - Any change to the codebase, whether a small bug fix or a major update, will be released as an **update**. These updates should follow a structured process to avoid disruptions:
    - Ensure that all updates are tested before deployment.
    - Deployments should occur during designated time windows to minimize impact on active users or collaborators.

- **Rollback Procedures**:
  - In case of an issue with an update, the following rollback strategies should be used:
    - If possible, **deactivate** or leave the problematic file dormant while a fix is prepared.
    - If deactivation is not possible, **roll back** the project to the most recent stable version.
  
- **Documentation**:
  - Every deployment must be accompanied by clear documentation, which can take the form of:
    - **Patch notes**: Brief descriptions of the changes, fixes, and updates introduced.
    - **Update notes**: A more detailed explanation of the improvements and additions in the release.
    - **Process documentation**: A detailed overview of the deployment process, if necessary, to track the procedures followed during the release.

The goal is to ensure that updates are organized, documented, and reversible when needed, keeping projects running smoothly.

### 8. **Review Process**

The code review process should ensure that all changes meet the project's standards and quality expectations. Reviews can be conducted by either human reviewers or automated tools, provided the following guidelines are followed:

- **Review Methods**:
  - Code can be reviewed by **human team members** or **non-invasive robots** that analyze the code for correctness, style, and potential issues. Automated tools should not disrupt the developer's workflow or introduce invasive changes.
  
- **Feedback and Revisions**:
  - All feedback should be provided in an organized and constructive manner, and **documented** for future reference.
  - Methods of feedback include:
    - **Comments** within code repositories or directly on the code itself.
    - **Face-to-face interactions** for more direct and immediate feedback.
    - Any other form of communication that efficiently conveys necessary feedback and suggestions for improvement.
  
- **Documentation of Reviews**:
  - The feedback, changes requested, and the revision process should be documented to ensure clarity and maintain a history of the review process. This can include comments on pull requests, revision logs, or formal review documents.

The aim is to maintain an efficient and transparent review process, ensuring that feedback is constructive and revisions are managed in a clear and organized way.

### 9. **Community Contributions**

Community contributions are welcome but will be subject to a review process to ensure quality and alignment with the project's goals. The following guidelines outline how community contributions will be managed:

- **Contribution Review**:
  - All contributions, whether code, documentation, or suggestions, will be **reviewed and processed** by the project team. Not all contributions will make it into the final product, as each will be assessed based on its relevance, quality, and alignment with the project’s roadmap.

- **Licensing**:
  - Contributors may be required to obtain a **specific license** to submit their work. This license will be easy to apply for and may be necessary to ensure legal compliance and protect the integrity of the project.

- **Issue Tracking**:
  - Community members can raise issues related to the project via the issue tracker. These issues will be evaluated by the team, and valid issues will be added to the project's backlog. Contributors are encouraged to provide detailed information to help resolve the issue efficiently.

- **Pull Requests**:
  - Contributions should be submitted via pull requests. Each pull request must:
    - Be clear about the purpose of the contribution.
    - Include necessary documentation (if applicable) explaining the change.
    - Pass any relevant tests and follow the project's coding conventions before being reviewed for merging.

- **Code of Conduct**:
  - Contributors are expected to adhere to a **basic code of conduct**:
    - They should make necessary changes and updates in a **respectful and constructive manner**.
    - Active engagement is not required, but contributors should follow through on revisions if feedback is provided.
  
Contributions are encouraged, but the project team maintains discretion over what will be integrated, ensuring that only the highest quality work is merged into the project.

### 10. **Maintenance and Updates**

The **Meisei Standard** is designed to evolve over time, with a clear process for making updates and revisions. This process ensures that changes are well-considered and reflect both community input and team approval.

- **Proposing Changes**:
  - Anyone can propose a change to the standard. However, to prevent abuse, the following process must be followed:
    - **Initial Vote**: The suggestion must be voted on by both the community **and** the Meisei team, or by Tomoko directly. The Meisei team retains the right to **veto** Tomoko's decision if necessary.
    - **Revisions**: If the suggestion passes the initial vote, the Meisei team will make revisions to incorporate the change.
    - **Final Vote**: The revised proposal will then be presented to the community for a vote. The cycle of review and voting will continue until a **2/3 majority** is reached.
    - Once the final vote is successful, the revision will be officially integrated into the standard.

- **Annual Review**:
  - A formal **conference** will be held once a year to assess the **relevance and effectiveness** of the standard.
  - During this review, any potential revisions that will be made indefinitely will be discussed. However, these revisions **cannot compromise** the core values or principles of the standard.
  - The effectiveness of the standard will be tested, and decisions about long-term changes or improvements will be made based on the results.

This structured process ensures that the standard remains up-to-date and functional while allowing for thoughtful and democratic improvements over time.
